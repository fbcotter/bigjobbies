<h1>Container images required</h1>

<p>This application makes use of Docker container images to function. Currently
you're missing the following images:</p>

<p>
  {% for name in missing %}
  <div class="chip">{{ name }}</div>
  {% endfor %}
</p>

<p>
You will need to ensure that your user account has access to Docker to build
images. If this is the case then you can submit a job to build the images. You
can check which images are already built in the
<a href="{{ url_for('images') }}">list of images</a>. If you've already
submitted a build job, you can check its progress in the
<a href="{{ url_for('qstat') }}">job queue</a>.
</p>

<form method="POST" action="{{ url_for('build_images') }}">
  <button class="btn waves-effect waves-light" type="submit" name="action">
    <i class="material-icons right">build</i>
    Build container images
  </button>
</form>
